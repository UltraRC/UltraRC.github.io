<p>My 3D printer (Tevo Tarantula) did not come with a spool holder. For the time I have owned this machine, whenever I printed anything, I would periodically  check the print and manually unwind an appropriate amount of 3D printing filament. More recently I have rested the filament spool on the wheel of my skateboard which has a bearing in it allowing the spool to unwind freely. This video uses this idea of the spool simply resting on a bearing to make for a more permanent solution to the problem.</p>
