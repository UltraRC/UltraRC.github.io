<h1>Oscilloscope Graphics</h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Analog oscilloscopes are interesting devices. They work by directing a beam of electronics at a phosphor-luminescent screen leaving a bright trail of green where the beam was directed. Normally, oscilloscopes help you to visualise a changing voltage like the sound signal coming from an electric guitar or the AC power flowing through the electrical grid. The older CRT scopes often have a feature called XY mode whereby the two input channels of the scope control the x and y axis position of the electron beam. In this mode, changing the voltage on channel 1 will move the beam left and right, and channel 2, up and down.</p>
